Hello,

Here is my personal DWM-config and some other useful stuff. Feel free to edit and share.  
You can find the other stuff in the "other"-directory. There are:  
  
* Xresources // My urxvt-config
* xinitrc // For autostarting the conky statusbar
* conkyrc // My conky-config

You should move all three files in your homedirectory as hidden files.  
For example: *.xinitrc*
Moreover you can find a PKGBUILD-file for archlinux in this directory for easy install.  
Just type in: *makepkg -si*
nice greetings,

**Shibumi**
